Title: Shiny Apps as Package Demos
Version: 0.9

Description: This package is designed to run Shiny apps included in
    packages in the inst/shiny/ directory. In addition to providing a
    standardized way of running apps within packages, it extends the
    typical process of running Shiny apps by allowing function parameters
    to be passed to the application. Utility functions for the developer
    are provided to safely check for parameter values and to retrieve
    defaults if the application is run outside of the package.
