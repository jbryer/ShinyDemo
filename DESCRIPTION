Description: Framework designed to run Shiny applications (Chang, et al,
    2021 <https://shiny.rstudio.com>, Wickham, 2021 <isbn:9781492047384>)
    included in packages, particulary for applications that are designed
    to demostrate the features of the package. In addition to providing a
    standardized way of running applications from within packages, it
    extends the typical process of running applications by allowing
    function parameters to be passed to the application.
