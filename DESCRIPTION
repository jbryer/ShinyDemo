Description: Framework designed to run Shiny applications (Chang, et al,
    2021 https://shiny.rstudio.com, Wickham, 2021 ISBN:9781492047384)
    included in packages, particularly for applications that are designed
    to demonstrate the features of the package. In addition to providing a
    standardized way of running applications from within packages, it
    extends the typical process of running applications by allowing
    function parameters to be passed to the application.
